<h1>pandas and Numpy basics for Data Analysis</h1>
<h2>Description:</h2><p>This repository contains my solutions and explorations of basic data analysis tasks using pandas. The tasks are part of various lab assignments where I've practiced working with pandas for tasks such as data cleaning, manipulation, and basic analysis. The goal is to showcase my understanding of pandas fundamentals and my commitment to learning and applying data analysis skills.</p>
<h2>Contents:</h2>
<p>
-Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) containing my solutions to lab tasks.<br>
-Data: The Datasets i have used in code is pushed to the repo.<br>
-Documentation: If you want to practice the basics, you can download the repo and perform the step by step process. The datasets links are mentioned in the notebook.</p>

<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>Feel free to explore the notebooks to see how I approached and solved different pandas tasks. If you have any suggestions or improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request. </p>
<h2>Additional Notes:</h2>
<p>This repository is a part of my journey in learning data analysis, and I welcome feedback and collaboration.
